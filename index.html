    <h4>Come on, what's the best breakfast you can have?... PANCAKES!!!</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients to the best Pancake Recipe ever</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour

      3 ½ teaspoons baking powder
      
      1 tablespoon white sugar
      
      ¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
      
      1 ¼ cups milk
      
      3 tablespoons butter, melted
      
      1 egg</p>

          <p>
            Some sporting feats ridicule expectations, fewer violate logic but the rarest of all added a defying of gravity to a hat-trick of achievements. At 3.45pm on 18 October 1968 in Mexico City’s Estadio Olímpico Universitario Bob Beamon accomplished all three.

         <p>
              With the game locked at 10 – 10 with thirty minutes on the clock, a Munster scrum just outside the Biarritz line enabled Peter Stringer to do the unexpected and break on the blindside for an unforgettable try. A moment of sheer brilliance by the Munster and Ireland scrumhalf. The try proved to be crucial as Munster won by 23 – 19 to lift the European Cup in Cardiff.

             <h3 class="computing-history">The First Programmer</h3>
         <p>Ada Lovelace, whose real name was Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, and daughter to the poet Lord Byron, is widely considered to be the world’s first computer programmer, at least in the theoretical sense. As a young woman, Lovelace befriended the mathematician Charles Babbage who wrote plans for the Analytical Engine, a clockwork counting machine

             <h3 class="computing-history">The First Compiler</h3>
         <p>
            Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers.

    <p>This week, we learn about DOM Events Local Storage and JSON Local Storage</p>
    <p>Accessing Elements

      Using getElementById('id') to select an individual element by its id attribute.
      Using querySelector('css selector') to select an individual element based on CSS selector syntax.
      Using getElementsByClassName('class') to select one or more elements by their class attribute.
      Using getElementsByTagName('tag') to select all elements with a specified tag name.
      Using querySelectorAll('css selector') to select multiple elements based on CSS selector syntax.</p>
    <p>Accessing Elements - Details

      getElementById('id'): Selects by id, requires an id attribute in the HTML.
      getElementsByClassName('class'): Selects by class attribute, returns a node list.
      getElementsByTagName('tag'): Selects by tag name, returns all elements with that tag.
      querySelector('css selector'): Selects by CSS selector, returns the first matching element.
      querySelectorAll('css selector'): Selects by CSS selector, returns all matching elements.</p>
      <p>NodeList and Individual Nodes

        Use item() method or array syntax to access individual nodes from a NodeList.
        Example: elements.item(0) or elements[0] to get the first element.</p>

    <p>Activity: Random User Generation using Fetch

      Fork the repl.it at wk08-ca-randomuser.
      Generate random user using the Fetch method from RandomUser API.
      Additional Challenge: Use JS & jQuery to display random user profile on "Next User" button click.
      Note: Results will be in a JSON object. Use a viewer to check your data first.</p>
    <p>Event Listener

      Use document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {...} to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before executing the script.
      Fetch PSI data asynchronously using fetch and handle the response with promises.
      Display PSI readings and store three-hourly readings in local storage.</p>

    <h2 id="week14">Week 14</h2>
    <p>This week, we learn about Lottie Animation, it is very very useful for small animation.</p>
    <p>Lottie Editor

      Frames per second, graphic dimensions, length of animation, layers in SVG.
      Basic shapes are converted, and further modification is possible.
      Limitations: Constrained by SVG and preset animations. For precise animation, use After Effects with the Bodymovin plugin.</p>
    <p>Lottie Tools & Resources

      Extension for VSCode for previewing, searching, and editing Lottie files.
      Extension Installation or search for "Lottie Files" in VS Code.
      Ensure the correct extension is installed, and right-clicking on Lottie JSON allows preview in Lottie Player.</p>
    <p>
      Converting SVG to Lottie on LottieFiles
      
      Sign up on LottieFiles.
      Visit https://lottiefiles.com/svg-to-lottie.
      Drag and drop SVG files (requires a LottieFiles account).
      Choose an animation type.
      Save to your workspace for download.
      Getting SVG Files
      
      Export .AI files from Illustrator to SVG.
      Download SVG from online resources (e.g., flaticon, freesvg.org, undraw, svgrepo, nounproject, iconfinder, Google).
      Always attribute your resources.</p>
