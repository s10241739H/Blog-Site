    <h2>Ingredients to the best Pancake Recipe ever</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour

      3 ½ teaspoons baking powder
      
      1 tablespoon white sugar
      
      ¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
      
      1 ¼ cups milk
      
      3 tablespoons butter, melted
      
      1 egg</p>

      <p></p>

        <tr>
        <td>Step 1</td>
        <td>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</td>

        <tr>
        <td>Step 2</td>
        <td>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes.

          <p>
            Some sporting feats ridicule expectations, fewer violate logic but the rarest of all added a defying of gravity to a hat-trick of achievements. At 3.45pm on 18 October 1968 in Mexico City’s Estadio Olímpico Universitario Bob Beamon accomplished all three.

          <h3 class="sports-history">Rugby</h3>
         <p>
              With the game locked at 10 – 10 with thirty minutes on the clock, a Munster scrum just outside the Biarritz line enabled Peter Stringer to do the unexpected and break on the blindside for an unforgettable try. A moment of sheer brilliance by the Munster and Ireland scrumhalf. The try proved to be crucial as Munster won by 23 – 19 to lift the European Cup in Cardiff.

             <h3 class="computing-history">The First Programmer</h3>
         <p>Ada Lovelace, whose real name was Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, and daughter to the poet Lord Byron, is widely considered to be the world’s first computer programmer, at least in the theoretical sense. As a young woman, Lovelace befriended the mathematician Charles Babbage who wrote plans for the Analytical Engine, a clockwork counting machine

             <h3 class="computing-history">The First Compiler</h3>
         <p>
            Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers.
